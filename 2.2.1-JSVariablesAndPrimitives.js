// create a constant variable (const)
const x = 100
// create a variable that can be reassigned (let)
let m = 32
// create three variables and assign them values of different data types (=)
let a = 19; let n =" hello there,"; let p = true;
// print the types of two variables that reference two different data types (typeof)
// TIP: console.log() prints a value in the console/terminal
console.log (typeof n);
console.log (typeof p);
// change the value referenced by a variable (dynamic typing)
m = 34;
// print the type of the variable you just changed (typeof)
console.log(m);
// create variables and give them values to complete the sentences that will print
let i = "its a wonderful morning!"
let b = n + " " + i;

// ? which variables need to be created?
strings
// ? what type of data needs to go in each variable?
